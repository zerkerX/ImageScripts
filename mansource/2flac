NAME
  2flac - convert audio files in the current directory to FLAC
SYNOPSIS
  2flac
DESCRIPTION
  2flac converts every audio file of the m4a, ape or wav formats in the
  current working directory to the flac(1) format instead.
  Original files are sent to the system
  trash using the trash(1) utility, if available.
  Due to problems with some players, any embedded album art is then
  removed using the metaflac(1) utility.
NOTES
  If missing, the trash(1) utility can be installed via the trash-cli
  package on Debian systems.
SEE ALSO
  flac(1), metaflac(1), trash(1)

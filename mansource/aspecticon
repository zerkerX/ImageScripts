NAME
  aspecticon - adjusts image files in the current directory to a square 256x256 icon image
SYNOPSIS
  aspecticon
DESCRIPTION
  aspecticon converts every image file of a variety of formats 
  (tga, bmp, png, gif, jpeg)
  in the current working directory to a 256x256 png
  image. If the image is not square, transparent letter or pillarboxing
  is added to preserve the aspect while ending up with a square result.
  Conversion is performed using ImageMagick(1)'s composite(1) utility.
  The output files are placed into a 'out' subfolder, 
  which is created if needed.
